[![Waffle.io stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/streetmix/streetmix.png?label=ready&title=Issues ready)](https://waffle.io/streetmix/streetmix)

If you have the capacity to write code, and wish to contribute to
Streetmix, we'd love your help!

**A request:** before you write any new feature or code, please [open an
issue][], or comment on the issue you'd like to work on. That way the
maintainers of the project can guide your work from the outset, making
it more likely that we'll be able to accept your work when it's ready.

In general, you can help by:

* Writing or editing documentation
* Writing code (**no patch is too small**: fix typos, add comments, clean up
  inconsistent whitespace)
* Refactoring code
* Closing [issues][]
* Reviewing patches

Once your code is ready, please push your work to a feature branch on
your fork of the Streetmix repo, and submit a pull request to us.

## Development Setup

### First-time setup

#### On Mac OS X 10

These installation instructions assume that you have already installed the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package manager.

1) Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

    brew install nodejs

2) Download, install and start [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).

    brew install mongodb

You'll also need to set up the [MongoDB data directory](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#run-mongodb). The easiest set up would be (you may need `sudo`):

    mkdir -p /data/db
    chmod 777 /data/db

3) Clone this remote repository to a folder on your computer.

    git clone https://github.com/streetmix/streetmix.git

4) Install project dependencies.

    cd streetmix
    npm install


#### On Windows

Streetmix was not developed on a Windows platform, and testing is limited. We've been able to successfully stand up a local installation on 64-bit Windows 7-based Dell laptops for an event without Internet access. These instructions below will assume that the user has basic familiarity with Git, GitHub, and the Windows Terminal command line interface, and has administrative permissions to install software on the machine.

##### Installing core dependencies

You may skip each of these steps if a fairly recent stable version is already present on the system.

* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/download/win).
* Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). The site should detect your system and provide you with the correct installer, but you may specify the package at http://nodejs.org/download/ (e.g. Windows 64-bit installer).
* Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads). Select the appropriate Windows installer package from their downloads page.
* Install [a modern browser](http://browsehappy.com/). Streetmix has been tested in Chrome (preferred), Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer 11. (Previous versions of Internet Explorer will not work.)

##### Installing Streetmix

1) In the command line terminal, clone a copy of the Streetmix repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/streetmix/streetmix.git

You may additionally specify the name of the directory to install to, if you wish.

2) Go into the project’s root directory and install all Node libraries.

    cd streetmix
    npm install

3) Set up the MongoDB environment. [Follow the instructions under “Set up the MongoDB environment” from the MongoDB website.](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#run-mongodb)

4) Make sure to add MongoDB binaries to your system path. Go to Control Panel > System > Advanced > Environment Variables > System Variables > find "Path" > Edit > Add `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin`

##### Running Windows Specific Notes:

* In Streetmix package.json rename `prestart` script to `dbstart`
* Open up two command prompt windows and navigate to the streetmix project root directory.
* In the first type `npm run dbstart`
* In the second type `npm start`

#### On all systems

1) Setup environment variables. You can either set these in your `.bash_profile` (or equivalent, on Mac OSX or *nix-based systems) or place them in a file named `.env` in the project root directory (great for development environments or Windows environments).

| Variable name                   | Description                   | Required?            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `SENDGRID_USERNAME`             | Your SendGrid username        | Yes                  |
| `SENDGRID_PASSWORD`             | Your SendGrid password        | Yes                  |
| `TWITTER_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY`    | Twitter OAuth consumer key    | Yes                  |
| `TWITTER_OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET` | Twitter OAuth consumer secret | Yes                  |
| `EMAIL_FEEDBACK_RECIPIENT`      | Your e-mail address           | No                   |
| `NO_INTERNET_MODE`              | Boolean. Set to `true` to run a local "demo" without external Internet access | No                   |

A sample `.env` file will look like this:

```
SENDGRID_USERNAME=username@domain.com
SENDGRID_PASSWORD=p@$$w0rD
TWITTER_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY=twitteroauthconsumerkey
TWITTER_OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET=twitteroauthsecrettoken
EMAIL_FEEDBACK_RECIPIENT=test@domain.com
NO_INTERNET_MODE=true
```

*Note:* If `NO_INTERNET_MODE` is true, you do not need the Sendgrid or Twitter authentication keys, as those will be disabled due to lack of Internet.


### HOWTO: Start the application

1) Start the web server. (This also automatically starts MongoDB in the background.)

    cd streetmix
    npm start

2) Load the application in your web browser.

    open http://127.0.0.1:8000


### HOWTO: Run browser integration tests

1) Run browser tests locally

    npm test
